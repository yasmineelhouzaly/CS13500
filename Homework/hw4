// The user will enter three number and the program will tell if these three umber are increasing, decreasing or neither.

/*
Write a program that reads three numbers and prints “increasing” 
if they are in increasing order, “decreasing” if they are in decreasing order, 
and “neither” other- wise. Here, “increasing” means “strictly increasing”, 
with each value larger than its predecessor. 
The sequence 3 4 4 would not be considered increasing.
